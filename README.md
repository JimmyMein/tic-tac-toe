## Plans

1. Create a website that will allow two players take turns, one only using 'X' and the other 'O'. Log each players decisions ona a 9x9 grid and declare a winner if one player was able to get 3 of their symbols in a row.


2. Create a wireframe to plot out the basic design and which html elements I'll be spliting my sections into

3. Using a similar method to the red-green box homework, I will need to create a Script that will allow me to click the targeted boxes, log the players input and switch turns and then finish the game with the condition of either a Win/lose or draw.
